-- Callsigns

-- Lookup order for an officer:
--   1. Callsigns.Jobs[<job name>]      — e.g. 'lspd'
--   2. Callsigns.JobTypes[<job type>]  — e.g. 'leo'
--   3. nothing → the picker refuses and tells you which job is unconfigured
-- A Jobs entry replaces the JobTypes entry completely; it is not merged into it. If
-- one department needs its own block of numbers, spell that block out in full.
-- Per block:
--   Min, Max   (required) the pickable range
--   Pad        digits to pad to: 2 → 01..99, 3 → 001..999. 0 or omitted = no padding
--   Prefix     e.g. 'L-' gives L-01. Omitted = bare numbers
--   PageSize   boxes shown before "Load more" (default 20)
--   Reserved   restricted, not forbidden: only somebody with the
--              roster_callsign_reserved permission may hand these out
--   Blocked    forbidden outright. No permission unlocks a blocked callsign — it is
--              the config saying "this number does not exist". Use it for numbers the
--              radio uses, numbers you're holding back, or ones you never want issued.
-- Reserved and Blocked take a LIST of entries — single numbers and ranges:
--   Reserved = {
--       { n = 1, why = 'Chief of Police' },             -- one number
--       { from = 2, to = 5, why = 'Command staff' },    -- a range
--   }
-- The bracket form ([1] = 'Chief of Police') is NOT accepted, and that's deliberate.
-- In Lua a keyless entry IS index 1, so writing
--       { [1] = 'Chief of Police', { from = 2, to = 5, why = 'Command staff' } }
-- makes the range overwrite the Chief while the file is being read — the string is
-- gone before any code can see it, so it can't be detected, only prevented. The
-- resource therefore refuses the bracket form outright and tells you what to write.
